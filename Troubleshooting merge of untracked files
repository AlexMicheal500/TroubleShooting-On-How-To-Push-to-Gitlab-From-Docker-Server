My guess is that someone else has accidentally committed this file. How to resolve this:

Remove your local .pyc file

rm rtb_redis_connections/redis_connections.pyc
Do the pull

git pull
Remove the file from git and push up the changes

git rm rtb_redis_connections/redis_connections.pyc
git commit -m "Remove pyc file"
git push origin master
Assuming that you are working on the master branch that is.
